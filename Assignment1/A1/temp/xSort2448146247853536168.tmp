a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it 
altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or at least 
analytic to be verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still 
and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating 
and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary 
and such as indicated resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal 
and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my 
announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less 
as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm

been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the 
between them, both of which, according to their direction,  were 
by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface.  If, 
calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby 
calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I 
cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my 
capricious and unreliable --they live in the varying outer weather, and they 
captain's quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, 
capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal 
cashier Ahab.  Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more 
combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the 
companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.  Again: At all 
competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently 
complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves 
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards 
constitution of 
crew to be subjected to.  For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too 
cuttle-fish --lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but 
daily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old 
evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, 
events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own 
exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, 
exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though not 
eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, 
fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership, unless 
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden 
for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life 
for the final dash.  Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of 
gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself. 
gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had they been strictly held to 
get out of order.  He knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency 
go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same 
have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale --squid or 
hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even breeds 
him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was 
hospitable shore.  The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the 
if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more 
impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end 
in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's 
in some respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the 
influential with him.  It would be refining too much, perhaps, even 
inhale its fickleness --and when retained 
intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but 
interests and employment should intervene and hold them healthily suspended 
interests to that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by

meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night 
multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to 
nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, 
no means incapable of swaying him.  To accomplish his object Ahab must use 
noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and 
obscure background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted

seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the dismal looking wreck,

some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon
