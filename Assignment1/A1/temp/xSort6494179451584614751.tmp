trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with 
turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that

unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the 
venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, 
very slip-shod, I assure ye.  Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and 
were three ships up for three-years' voyages --The Devil-Dam the Tit-bit, 
where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale --her masts stood 
with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; 
with that.  Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having 


 
 
 
 
 
 
     What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?  Lost by a whale! 
     Who is Captain Ahab, sir?  Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the 
     Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the 
     accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language --that man

Captain Ahab? 
Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, 
Captain himself.  Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg --that's who ye are 
Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?  he demanded.  I was 
Captain of this ship.  I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the 
Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many 
Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers,

about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the 
about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?  I do, sir.  Very

all about whaling, I dare say --eh?  Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I

causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.  Such 
consistency about worthy Captain Bildad.  Though refusing, from conscientious 
crew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if thou 
do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed 
don't take to be the fact.  Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to

go in order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.  Well 
go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world where

in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a

insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and 
invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, 
lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit.  Sure,

noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, 
now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness 
of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out.  Clap eye 
of shipping ye.  Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see 
of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service indeed!  I suppose now

over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with 
overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically 
peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by 
peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by 
peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a 
ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long
