at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed 
awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like the Lord out

face of Falsehood!  That was it!  This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; 
face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
