out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this light, the 
part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say --This man had no 
phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His cranial cavity is continuous with the first

profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read

pyramidical silence.  And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been

skull, whoever you are.  A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and

spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the sperm whale's hump.  This

vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked
