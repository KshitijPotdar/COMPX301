their own scythes --though in no wise obliged to furnished them -- even so, 
they were.  But, alas!  the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even 
things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and 
throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he would

to let it go, though hacked in pieces.  In vain the captain threatened to throw

unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable 
untutored youth.  A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg 
well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.  His story being 
were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides 
whaleman to embark from.  He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, 
wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.  The owners of his ship, 
when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to 
whom I now companied with.  We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our 
woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a

I, Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think.  Didn't

Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!  Look you, 
Queequeg, what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don't you know you might have 
Rokovoko, and its commander --from all accounts, a very stately punctilious 
Tartar air! --how I spurned that turnpike earth! --that common highway all over 
a ship --as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the 
about the thing --though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise 
air; then slightly 
all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and mountains of casks on 
almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of 
almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the 
and centre of all verdure.  Queequeg caught one of these young saplings 
and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept 
around him, seemed to be saying to himself -- It's a mutual, joint-stock 
as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this

being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom 
being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of 
boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and back again, 
boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after 
bowl; --taking it i suppose for a huge finger-glass.  now, said Queequeg, 
brows as a slave before the Sultan.  Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; 
bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain 
bumpkin, running towards that officer; Capting, Capting, here's the devil. 
bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart 
by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering 
canes in land tornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood 
carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the 
casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale 
clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from 
consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the 
cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, 
dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the 
endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.  Gaining the 
every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian 
face into an unearthly expression of disdain, ah!  him bevy small-e fish-e; 
fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything 
foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.  His dusky nostrils 
from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.  He only asked for water --fresh 
from the water, Queequeg now took an instant's glance around him, and 
gentleman, at least for a sea captain --this commander was invited to the 
glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two 
grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to send 
have their grace as well as we --though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who

in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant

lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those 
luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down 
magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.  At the same 
mimicking him behind his back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. 
minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the 
minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms 
more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there were some boobies and 
more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the 
one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees 
only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the 
other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The poor 
our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her 
over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all 
part of the deck.  The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was

perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended,

pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one most 
placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and 
quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.  How I snuffed that

seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few 
ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of 
snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of 
still shivering greenhorn.  Kill-e, cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed 
straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through 
strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous 
swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth.  On, on we flew, and
