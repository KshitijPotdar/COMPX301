     That night, in the mid-watch, 
     To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long 
     horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth 
     power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think 
     right away from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.  Be dumb, man!  Stand

Come, my Captain, study out the course,

Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the 
Tashtego.  Not the same instant; not the same --no, the doubloon is mine,

White Whale first.  There she blows!  there she blows! --there she blows! 
a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it 
ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  And did none of ye see 
ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and 
all hands!  Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the 
all the boat-sails set --all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, 
all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural

and let us away!  See, see!  the boy's face from the window!  the boy's hand 
as he so divinely swam.  On each soft side --coincident with the parted swell, 
assail it; but had fatally 
at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro 
before.  And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,

boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm

corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.  Ahab crossed the deck 
down, and left in the half-cut swaths --Starbuck!  But blanched to a 
drawing nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near. 
errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible 
face fiercely, snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in 
field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last year's scythes flung 
forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that 
found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, 
going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three

heart, I durst not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, 
his face to the sky.  Nothing, nothing, sir!  was the sound hailing down in 
his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. 
hump like a snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!  Fired by the cry which seemed 
involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out 
it before?  cried Ahab, hailing the perched men all around him.  I saw him 
lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery

living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner 
living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this 
lo!  that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea!  Look!  see yon Albicore!  who 
lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on 
man!  Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  But it is 
master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural 
matter how many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed 
mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the gliding whale.  Not the 
nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozzening, hidden lord and 
new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the 
no; only black water!  All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by! 
noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only 
now gained his final perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego 
of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his 
oh, whale!  thou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no 
on the hill!  But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he 
on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his 
pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.  A gentle joyousness --a

rapidly ordered the ship's course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be

rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had

seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly 
serenely it spread.  At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his 
set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, 
shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and 
shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.  What is it, what 
shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer 
shortened.  The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently

simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the

slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the 
slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the ocean grew still more 
smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so 
softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to 
some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but 
standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant mast, so that the

that but once leaving him, then flowed so wide away --on each bright side,

the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him

they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear 
thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering 
thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that 
tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.  Man the mast-heads!  Call 
to gaze over on the other side; but started at two reflected, fixed eyes in 
tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible jets.  He's 
top-gallant-sail, 
vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and 
visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually 
well that!  Boats, boats!  Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; 
whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing 
when the old man --as his wont at intervals --stepped forth from the scuttle in
