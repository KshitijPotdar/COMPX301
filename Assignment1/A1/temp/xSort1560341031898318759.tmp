no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain 
nor of the recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake, 
not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and 
now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon 
of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first 
old Gay-Head Indian once; but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another 
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness.  His whole 
overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, 
owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had previously 
painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And not only 
persuasiveness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually 
pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the 
ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green 
running away from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of 
sea-officers and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be 
secluded.  And, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in 
seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not

senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that 
shivers ran over me.  Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon 
sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such 
so that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, 
spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the 
sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a 
still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind 
straight out beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of 
straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning 
tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me 
tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels and

the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than 
the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and 
the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side of the Pequod's quarter

this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.  So, almost every 
three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly 
till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly 
to charm him from his mood.  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, 
to pile themselves upon.  Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling 
twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and the band on 
upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, 
watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding 
whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, 
when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, 
which I had so abandonedly embarked.  But it was especially the aspect of the 
whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the 
wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not

Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was 
about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too.  Damn me, 
and also his pipe.  lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the

back and strike him, or --what's that? -- down here on my knees and pray for

between a living thump and a dead thump.  That's what makes a blow from the

cane.  Yes," thinks I,"it was only a playful cudgelling --in fact, only a

coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as 
crippled way.  Some considerating touch of humanity was in him; for at times

ere long the old man would emerge, griping at the iron banister, to help his 
exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a 
fullest of trouble.  What business have I with this pipe?  This thing that is 
grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one 
greatest joke of the dream, Flask.  While I was battering away at the 
hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.  The

humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks,

keep me from catching it.  He's full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into
