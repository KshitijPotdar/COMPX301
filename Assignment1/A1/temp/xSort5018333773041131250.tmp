colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes 
consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the 
continual sight of the snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, 
cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); 
creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and 
creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells 
deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover 
distant oregon?  no: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the 
elucidated by the following examples.  First: The mariner, when drawing nigh 
especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or 
faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from 
fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, 
frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of 
full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of all 
ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, 
great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and 
hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the 
himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect 
his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness 
horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off 
if 
immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought 
in some peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey --why 
instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world.  Though 
is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe 
is under him again.  Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, Sir, it was 
landscape of snows --a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink? 
latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a 
legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half 
long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet 
monuments and splintered crosses.  But thou sayest, methinks this white-lead 
more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?  Nor is it, 
much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American, than those 
muskiness --why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in 
not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous 
not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why it 
nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and 
of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?  Or is it, 
operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and 
other earthly hues --every stately or lovely emblazoning --the sweet tinges of 
other storied structures, its neighbors --the Byward Tower, or even the 
over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of 
pallor unrestingly glides through the green of the groves --why is this phantom 
perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at 
perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black bisons of 
phrensies of affright?  There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild 
prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.  Thus, then, 
prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to 
rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched 
reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide 
rending, goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the 
rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.  I know that, to 
roses, with its own blank tinge --pondering all this, the palsied universe lies 
round him, then he feels 
scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of 
separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that 
shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, 
sleepiest of sunsets?  Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely 
somewhere those things must exist.  Though in many of its aspects this visible 
soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water 
spectralness 
stampedoes of her frantic seas: nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never 
strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This 
such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would 
sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the 
surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.  Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled 
that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of 
that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and 
that intensified terror.  As for the white shark, the white gliding 
the bare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is 
the coasts of foreign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts 
the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be 
the frightened colt!  Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of 
the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the festooned 
the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor 
the strangest, saddest city thou can'st see.  For Lima has taken the white 
things, nay, the very veil of the Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it 
this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have 
thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the 
to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose 
to vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his 
tossed pack of cards; --it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, 
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to 
universality.  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively 
veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe.  Old as 
views what seems a boundless church-yard grinning upon him with its lean ice 
whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at 
which the mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, 
whiteness that so stirred me?  Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the 
will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London tell so 
world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.  But 
ye then at the fiery hunt?
