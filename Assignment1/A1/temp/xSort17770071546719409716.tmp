found a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey's wedding ring.  How 
from him, we gaze for him in vain!  This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, 
gold.  And what's the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign --the

he's been studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his mind, poor fellow!  But 
headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his 
hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.  He 
here's nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy 'em 
here's signs and wonders truly!  That, now, is what old Bowditch in his 
in one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again!  here comes Queequeg --all 
insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer.  I have seen doubloons before 
inspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.  A dark valley between three 
is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace 
is ugly, too, for when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow 
it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.  Jollily he, 
it!  Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round 
it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I

look, they look.  Why, he's getting it by heart --hist!  again.  I look, 
look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.  Upon my soul, 
luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of the

mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint

now.  Signs and wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; 
of an old jacket.  Wonder if he means me? --complimentary! --poor lad! --I 
only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin 
or the Archer.  No: he don't know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it 
our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope.  If we

sleep.  There's a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through 
so; he's beginning.  I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, 
supply the thoughts.  That's my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts 
tattooing --looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says the

     ENDERBY, OF LONDON Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whale?  So cried Ahab,

     the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.  But, Lord, look

Englishman.  I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.  Well, one day 
I jumped into my first mate's boat --Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain

a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; 
after the second iron, to toss it overboard --down comes the tail like a Lima
